Using a python scrypt we simulate data sensors and we send them in JSON format to Thingsboard. The script is available on github
Before running the script, we need to download the library with this command: 
npm install mqtt --save


start the connection between the client and our broker using host:"demo.thingsboard.io", port:1883 and topic:"v1/devices/". 

bash script: curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d 

Check for import libs and import necessary libs
